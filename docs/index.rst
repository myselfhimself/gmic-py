Welcome to gmic-py's documentation!
===================================
``gmic-py`` is a Python 3 binding for the `G'MIC Image Processing Framework <https://gmic.eu/>`_ written in C++.

``gmic`` is the package name of `gmic-py on pypi.org <https://pypi.org/project/gmic/>`_, so you should ``pip install gmic`` (see :doc:`installing`).

G'MIC provides image-processing commands for 1D to 4D images, as well as many graphical filters.
It is thus targetted at both artists and data-scientists.
